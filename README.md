# weatherDash-hw6

*Objectives*

For this project my goal was to succesfully build a weather app that retrieves data from third party API and allows users to search and see weather information accordingly.

The requirements were:
* to use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities
* create a functioning website with 3 main components:
    1. Main component in the middle of the page with:
        * current day is displayed
        * icon that summarizes the weather
        * temperature
        * feels like temperature
        * humidity
        * wind speed
        *UV index

    2. a left column with a search bar (where users can lookup city weather info)
        * also users past searches should be listed below the search bar

    3. a weather forecast of 5 days in the section below the main body with:
        * icon that summarizes the weather
        * temperature
        * humidity

*Reflection*

The hardest part of this assignment was to not only understand how to maximize the use of functions we learned and practice jQuery.

When I started the jQuery part of the code, I only thought about the first part of the assignment, which was loading today's weather forecast on the main section of the page. 
After I coded out I realized that I could be more efficient with my code using for loops and if statements. So I started on a new script file (reason why its called script2) and simplified the code to it's minimum with maximum efficiency.

Then I ran into a problem of my components colliding against each other consequently creating bugs on my code. I can already feel that this is what I'm going to be doing from now on but WOW it is such tedious work trying to figure out where I had a type-O or a missed , or one too many brackets.

I will countinue on my JavaScript (and now jQuery!) journey and will try to be more careful with details in my code to lessen bugs (if I can but I feel like its a loosing battle).
